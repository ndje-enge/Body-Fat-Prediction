# Body Fat Prediction Analysis Project

## Project Description

This project consists of a comprehensive analysis and prediction of body fat percentage from anthropometric measurements. The objective is to develop machine learning models capable of accurately predicting an individual's body fat percentage based on simple body measurements.

## Objectives

- Analyze correlations between different body measurements and body fat percentage
- Develop and compare multiple machine learning models
- Identify the most important features for prediction
- Provide insights on factors influencing body composition

## Dataset

The dataset contains **252 observations** with **15 features**:

### Main Features:
- **Density**: Body density
- **BodyFat**: Body fat percentage (target variable)
- **Age**: Age in years
- **Weight**: Weight in kg (converted from pounds)
- **Height**: Height in cm (converted from inches)
- **Neck**: Neck circumference in cm
- **Chest**: Chest circumference in cm
- **Abdomen**: Abdomen circumference in cm
- **Hip**: Hip circumference in cm
- **Thigh**: Thigh circumference in cm
- **Knee**: Knee circumference in cm
- **Ankle**: Ankle circumference in cm
- **Biceps**: Biceps circumference in cm
- **Forearm**: Forearm circumference in cm
- **Wrist**: Wrist circumference in cm

### Derived Features:
- **BMI**: Calculated Body Mass Index

## Data Preprocessing

### 1. Unit Conversion
- Conversion from inches to centimeters for height
- Conversion from pounds to kilograms for weight

### 2. Multicollinearity Management
- Removal of `Density` column (too correlated with `BodyFat`)
- Identification and removal of highly correlated features (>0.8)
- Application of a penalty system to eliminate redundancies

### 3. Normalization
- Application of square root transformation on the `Age` variable to improve distribution
